Solve the equation below for $x$.
\[ 2^{5x+2} = \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^{4x-5} \]The solution is \( x = 0.783 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}$x = -0.571$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only.
* $x = 0.783$, which is the correct option.
$x = -7.000$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different.
$x = 9.600$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only.
This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.

Solve the equation below for $x$.
\[  14 = \sqrt[5]{\frac{29}{e^{4x}}} \]The solution is \( x = -2.457, \text{ which does not fit in any of the interval options.} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}$x = 2.457$, which is the negative of the correct solution.
$x = -18.342$, which corresponds to thinking you don't need to take the natural log of both sides before reducing, as if the right side already has a natural log.
$x = -0.478$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root.
This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation.
* $x = -2.457$ is the correct solution and does not fit in any of the other intervals.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(29)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.

Describe the Domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = -\log_2{(x+2)}+7 \]The solution is \( (-2, \infty) \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* $(-2, \infty)$, which is the correct option.
$[7, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift when shifting the Domain AND including the endpoint.
$(-\infty, 2)$, which corresponds to flipping the Domain. Remember: the general for is $a*\log(x-h)+k$, \textbf{where $a$ does not affect the domain}.
$(-\infty, -7]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND including the endpoint AND flipping the domain.
This corresponds to thinking of the range of the log function (or the domain of the exponential function).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.

$(-\infty, 4]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint.
$[-4, \infty)$, which corresponds to including the endpoint.

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.
