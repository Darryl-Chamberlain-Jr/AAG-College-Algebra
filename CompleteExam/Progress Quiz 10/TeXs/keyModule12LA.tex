Determine the vertical asymptotes and holes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{12x^{3} +5 x^{2} -43 x -30}{8x^{2} +18 x + 9} \]

The solution is \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.5 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.75 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.5 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.75 \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.5 \text{ and } x = -1.667 \text{ with a hole at } x = -0.75 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.5 \text{ and } x = -0.75 \text{ with no holes.} \)

This corresponds to not factoring out the hole.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.5 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.75 \)

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\item \( \text{Holes at } x = -1.5 \text{ and } x = -0.75 \text{ with no vertical asymptotes.} \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as holes.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to factor the numerator and denominator. Any factors that cancel are holes in the function. The zeros left in the denominator are the vertical asymptotes.

\litem{
Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{12x^{3} -11 x^{2} -7 x + 6}{4x^{2} -9 x -9} \]

The solution is \( y = 3x + 4 \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 3x + 4 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote at } y = 3.0 \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as horizontal asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.0  \)

This corresponds to using rule for Horizontal Asymptote when degree of numerator and denominator match.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 3x + 4 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote AND mixing up horizontal/vertical asymoptote.
\item \( \text{Oblique Asymptote of } y = 3x + 4. \)

This is the correct answer.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a Horizontal Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to the degree of the denominator. We have an Oblique Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. We cannot have both!
