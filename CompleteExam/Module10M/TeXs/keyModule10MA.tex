For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$ to find the coefficient for the model of the new volume $V_{	ext{new}} = k r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pepsi wants to increase the volume of soda in their cans. They've decided to increase the radius by 17 percent and increase the height by 10 percent. They want to model the new volume based on the radius and height of the original cans. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( k = 4.73058 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* This is the correct option and corresponds to the model: $V = \pi (1.17 r)^2 (1.10 h)$.
This corresponds to the model: $V = (1.17 r)^2 (1.10 h)$.
This corresponds to the model: $V = \pi (0.17 r)^2 (0.10 h)$.
This corresponds to the model: $V = (0.17 r)^2 (0.10 h)$.
If you chose this, please talk with the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the options are correct.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When calculating the new dimensions, you need to add/subtract from 100\%. For example, a 10\% increase in height would result in 110\% of the original height: $1.1h_{old} = h_{new}$.

A town has an initial population of 100000. The town's population for the next 9 years is provided below. Which type of function would be most appropriate to model the town's population?


\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\textbf{Year} &1 &2 &3 &4 &5 &6 &7 &8 &9\tabularnewline \hline
\textbf{Pop} &100000 &99986 &99978 &99972 &99967 &99964 &99961 &99958 &99956\end{tabular}The solution is \( \text{Logarithmic} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}This suggests a growth faster than constant but slower than exponential.
This suggests the fastest of growths that we know.
This suggests a constant growth. You would be able to add or subtract the same amount year-to-year if this is the correct answer.
This suggests the slowest of growths that we know.
Please contact the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the options model the population.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?

What model type would best describe the scenario below?

    \textit{ Social distancing is a common tactic to counter potential epidemics. This is due to the exponential increase in number of people infected as the density of people living in an area increases. }

For the scenario below, model the rate of vibration (cm/s) of the string in terms of the length of the string. Then determine the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible). The constant should be in terms of cm and s.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string. The rate of vibration of string $\omega$ decreases as the square length of the string increases. For example, when string $\omega$ is 5 mm long, the rate of vibration is 24 cm/s. }

This option uses the model $R = kl^{2}$ as if this is a direct variation.
This option uses the correct model, $R = \frac{k}{l^{2}}$, but does not convert from mm to cm so that the units match.

Talk with the coordinator if you chose this option.

\textbf{General Comment:} The most common mistake on this question is to not convert mm to cm! When modeling, you need to make sure all of the units for your variables are compatible.
