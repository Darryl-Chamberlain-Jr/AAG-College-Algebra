To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 4 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{4}{x} - 1}{x - 4} \]

The solution is \( \{ 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010, 4.0001 \} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 4.0100, 4.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010, 4.0001 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990, 3.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 4 on the left.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?
\[ As $x$ approaches $4$, $f(x)$ approaches $4.913$. \]

The solution is \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 4.913 \text{ when } x \text{ is close to } 4 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) = 4 \text{ when } x \text{ is close to } 4.913 \)

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 9} \frac{\sqrt{4x - 20} - 4}{2x - 18} \]

The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 1.000 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( 0.062 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( 0.125 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.250.

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 9$.

Evaluate the one-sided limit of the function $f(x)$ below, if possible.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 5 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
