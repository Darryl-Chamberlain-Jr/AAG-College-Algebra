A town has an initial population of 70000. The town's population for the next 10 years is provided below. Which type of function would be most appropriate to model the town's population?



\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\textbf{Year} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \tabularnewline
\hline
\textbf{Pop.} & 70026 & 70056 & 70094 & 70124 & 70146 & 70176 & 70214 & 70244 & 70266
\end{tabular} 

The solution is \( \text{Non-Linear Power} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Linear} \)

This suggests a constant growth. You would be able to add or subtract the same amount year-to-year if this is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Non-Linear Power} \)

This suggests a growth faster than constant but slower than exponential.
\item \( \text{Exponential} \)

This suggests the fastest of growths that we know.
\item \( \text{Logarithmic} \)

This suggests the slowest of growths that we know.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

Please contact the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the options model the population.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?

\litem{
For the information provided below, construct a linear model that describes the total distance of the path, $D$, in terms of the time spent on a particular path \textit{if we know that the time spent on each path was equal}.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ A bicyclist is training for a race on a hilly path. Their bike keeps track of their speed at any time, but not the distance traveled. Their speed traveling up a hill is 4 mph, 10 mph when traveling down a hill, and 7 mph when traveling along a flat portion. }
\end{center}


The solution is \( 21 t \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 21 t \)

* This is the correct option since time spent on each path is equal.
\item \( 0.493 t \)

The coefficient here is calculated as if you were trying to model the time on the total path.
\item \( 280 t \)

The coefficient here is calculated by multiplying the speeds together rather than adding them.
\item \( \text{The model can be found with the information provided, but isn't options 1-3.} \)

Since the time spent on each path was equal, we can treat all time variables as the same variable, $t$.
\item \( \text{The model cannot be found with the information provided.} \)

If you chose this option, please contact the coordinator to discuss why you think we cannot model the situation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure you pay attention to the variable we are writing the model in terms of. To create the model with a single variable, we have to know that variable is the same throughout each path!

\litem{
For the information provided below, construct a linear model that describes her total budget, $B$, as a function of the number of months, $x$ she is at UF.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Aubrey is a college student going into her first year at UF. She will receive Bright Futures, which covers her tuition plus a \$400 educational expense each year. Before college, Aubrey saved up \$11000. She knows she will need to pay \$1100 in rent a month, \$80 for food a week, and \$56 in other weekly expenses. }
\end{center}


The solution is \( B(x) = 11400 - 1644 x \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( B(x) = 10164 x \)

This treats the educational expense and savings as something you get every month rather than a 1-time payment AND treats weekly expenses as month expenses rather than multiplying each weekly expense by 4.
\item \( B(x) = 9756 x \)

This treats the educational expense and savings as something you get every month rather than a 1-time payment.
\item \( B(x) = 11400 - 1644 x \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( B(x) = 11400 - 1236 x \)

This treats weekly expenses as month expenses rather than multiplying each weekly expense.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

You may have chosen this if you thought you were modeling total costs or income.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This is a Costs, Profit, Revenue question! The most common issues here are: (1) not converting the weekly costs to monthly costs, (2) treating the one-time values like savings and educational expense as happening per month, and (3) not checking that your model is for cost, profit [income], or revenue [budget].

What is the \textbf{best} way to describe the domain of the scenario below?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Veronica needs to prepare 170 lbs of blended coffee beans to sell for \$4.71 per pound. She has a high-quality bean that sells for \$6.00 a pound and a low-quality been that sells for \$3.25 a pound. }
\end{center}


The solution is \( \text{Subset of the Rational numbers} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Proper subset of the Real numbers} \)

This means we have a domain of the Real numbers but need to throw out values based on the context.
\item \( \text{Subset of the Rational numbers} \)

Recall that the Rationals are fractions with Integers in the numerator and denominator.
\item \( \text{Subset of the Integers} \)

Recall that the Integers are the positive and negative counting numbers: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 
\item \( \text{Subset of the Natural numbers} \)

Recall that the Naturals are the counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...
\item \( \text{There is no restricted domain in this scenario} \)

This means we have a domain of the Real numbers and we don't need to remove any values even in the real-world context.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We often have to remove values in the domain when working with real-world models.

The solution is \( \text{None of the above.} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( C(x) = 9000 x \)

This describes the student's income as if they received the savings and educational expense each month.
\item \( C(x) = 9000 \)

This describes the student's income, not costs.
\item \( C(x) = 1234 \)

This treats weekly expenses as month expenses rather than multiplying each weekly expense by 4 AND does not account for these expenses per month.
\item \( C(x) = 1234 x \)

This treats weekly expenses as monthly expenses rather than multiplying each weekly expense by 4.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

* This is the correct option as the model should be $C(x) = 1636 x$.

Using the situation below, construct a linear model that describes the cost of the coffee beans $C(h)$ in terms of the weight of the low-quality coffee beans $h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Veronica needs to prepare 90 of blended coffee beans selling for \$2.92 per pound. She has a high-quality bean that sells for \$3.42 a pound and a low-quality bean that sells for \$2.38 a pound. }
\end{center}


The solution is \( C(h) = -1.04 h + 307.80 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( C(h) = 2.38 h \)

This models the cost of the low-quality bean only, not the blended beans.
\item \( C(h) = 1.04 h + 214.20 \)

This would be correct if the question asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the high-quality bean.
\item \( C(h) = 2.90 h \)

This assumes that exactly half of the high- and low- quality beans are mixed to create the blended coffee beans.
\item \( C(h) = -1.04 h + 307.80 \)

* This is the correct option since the questions asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the low-quality bean.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

If you chose this option, please talk to the coordinator to discuss why.

* This is the correct option.
\item \( 300.000 D \)

The coefficient here is calculated by multiplying the distances together rather than adding.
\item \( 21.000 D \)

The coefficient here is calculated as if you were trying to model the distance on the total path.
\item \( \text{The model can be found with the information provided, but isn't options 1-3.} \)

Since we know all parts of the path are equal length, we can treat all distance variables as the same variable, $D$.

* This is the correct option since the questions asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the low-quality bean.
\item \( C(h) = 1.15 h + 743.40 \)

This would be correct if the question asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the high-quality bean.
