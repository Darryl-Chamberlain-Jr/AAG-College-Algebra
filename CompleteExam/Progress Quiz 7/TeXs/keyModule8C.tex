Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = \log_2{(x+3)}-5 \]The solution is \( (-3, \infty) \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (-\infty, a), a \in [0.3, 3.5] \)

$(-\infty, 3)$, which corresponds to flipping the Domain. Remember: the general for is $a*\log(x-h)+k$, \textbf{where $a$ does not affect the domain}.
\item \( (-\infty, a], a \in [4.1, 9] \)

$(-\infty, 5]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND including the endpoint AND flipping the domain.
\item \( [a, \infty), a \in [-5.4, -3.6] \)

$[-5, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift when shifting the Domain AND including the endpoint.
\item \( (a, \infty), a \in [-3.6, -1.2] \)

* $(-3, \infty)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( (-\infty, \infty) \)

This corresponds to thinking of the range of the log function (or the domain of the exponential function).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.
