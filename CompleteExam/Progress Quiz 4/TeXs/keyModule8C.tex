Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = e^{x+1}+7 \]
The solution is \( (7, \infty) \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [a, \infty), a \in [5, 9] \)

$[7, \infty)$, which corresponds to including the endpoint.
\item \( (a, \infty), a \in [5, 9] \)

* $(7, \infty)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( (-\infty, a], a \in [-8, -1] \)

$(-\infty, -7]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint.
\item \( (-\infty, a), a \in [-8, -1] \)

$(-\infty, -7)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval.
\item \( (-\infty, \infty) \)

This corresponds to confusing range of an exponential function with the domain of an exponential function.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.
