The solution is \( \text{None of the above as it should be } f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 3} + 1 \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x - 3)^2} - 6 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$, the opposite leading coefficient, AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{(x + 3)^2} - 6 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$ not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x - 3} - 6 \)

Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$, the opposite leading coefficient AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 3} - 6 \)

The $y$-value of the equation does not match the graph.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

None of the equation options were the correct equation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.

Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{6}{15x^{2} -15} \]
The solution is \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = -1.000 \text{ and } x = 1.000. \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-3, 0] \text{ and } b \in [1, 5] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -1.000$ and $x = 1.000$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-28, -20] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -25.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-3, 0] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -1.000$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-28, -20] \text{ and } b \in [9, 10] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -25.000$ and $x = 9.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.

\litem{
Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{-6}{-5x -9} + -8 = \frac{-9}{15x + 27} \]
The solution is \( x = -1.575 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.88, -1.6] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-2.58,-0.57] \)

$x = -1.875 \text{ and } x = -1.575$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [1.6,2.33] \)

$x = 2.025$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-5x -9$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( x \in [-1.57,0.43] \)

* $x = -1.575$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

This corresponds to thinking $x = -1.575$ leads to dividing by zero in the original equation, which it does not.
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.59, -1.52] \text{ and } x_2 \in [1.02,3.02] \)

$x = -1.575 \text{ and } x = 2.025$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!
