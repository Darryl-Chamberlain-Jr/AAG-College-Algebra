Factor the polynomial below completely, knowing that $x -5$ is a factor. \textit{To make the problem easier, all zeros are between -5 and 5.}
\[ f(x) = 10x^{4} -69 x^{3} + x^{2} +510 x -200 \]The solution is \( [-2.5, 0.4, 4, 5] \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} Distractor 2: Corresponds to inversing rational roots.
 Distractor 1: Corresponds to negatives of all zeros.
* This is the solution!
 Distractor 3: Corresponds to negatives of all zeros AND inversing rational roots.
 Distractor 4: Corresponds to moving factors from one rational to another.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to try the middle-most integers first as these normally are the zeros. Also, once you get it to a quadratic, you can use your other factoring techniques to finish factoring.
