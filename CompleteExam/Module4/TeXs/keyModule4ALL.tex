 $(27x + 2)(2x + 5)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of a to c.
 Corresponds to a different factoring than any of the predicted options. If you get this, please let the coordinator know so they can work with you to figure out what went wrong with your factoring.

\textbf{General Comment:} $ac$ had many factors in this problem. It is best to list out the possible pairs in order to make sure you don't miss any.

Solve the quadratic equation below.
\[ 18x^{2} +14 x + 2 = 0 \]The solution is \( x_1 = -0.589 \text{ and } x_2 = -0.189 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} $x_1 = -7.600 \text{ and } x_2 = 6.822$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
 $x_1 = 0.189 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.589$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $\frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
 $x_1 = -10.606 \text{ and } x_2 = -3.394$, which corresponds to using the Quadratic Formula with $a=1$
* $x_1 = -0.589 \text{ and } x_2 = -0.189$, which is the correct option.
Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.

\textbf{General Comment:} This requires Quadratic Formula. Just be sure to use the correct formula and watch your signs.
