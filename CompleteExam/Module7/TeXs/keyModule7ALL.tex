All Real numbers except $x = -12.000$ and $x = 15.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.

Solve the rational equation below.
\[ \frac{-5x}{-3x -5} + \frac{-4x^{2}}{-9x^{2} -24 x -15} = \frac{5}{3x + 3} \]The solution is \( \text{There are two solutions: } x = -1.147 \text{ and } x = 1.147 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}

* $x = -1.147 \text{ and } x = 1.147$, which is the correct option.


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

The solution is \( \text{None of the above as it should be } f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 3} - 3 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x-h}+k$ and the opposite leading coefficient.
The $x$-value of the equation does not match the graph.
Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x-h}+k$, and the opposite leading coefficient.
Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$.
None of the equation options were the correct equation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.
