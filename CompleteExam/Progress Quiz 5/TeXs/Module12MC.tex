The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.
\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $190^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $16^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 10 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $126^{\circ}$ C. }
