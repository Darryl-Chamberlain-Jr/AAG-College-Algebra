Solve the modeling problem below, if possible.

    \textit{ A new virus is spreading throughout the world. There were initially 3 many cases reported, but the number of confirmed cases has tripled every 4 days. How long will it be until there are at least 10000 confirmed cases? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 30 \text{ days} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 18 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base and did not apply the properties of log correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 33 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base, but solved correctly otherwise.
\item \( \text{About } 30 \text{ days} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 17 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation correctly but did not apply the properties of log correctly.
\item \( \text{There is not enough information to solve the problem.} \)

If you chose this option, please contact the coordinator to discuss why you think this is the case.

\textbf{General Comment:} Set up the model the same as in Module 11M. Then, plug in 10000 and solve for $d$ in your model.

The solution is \( \text{Non-linear Power model} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Non-linear Power model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a polynomial or rational shape.
\item \( \text{Logarithmic model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want a rapid change early, then an extremely slow change later.
\item \( \text{Linear model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a mostly straight line of points.
\item \( \text{Exponential model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want an extremely slow change early, then a rapid change later.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want to see no pattern in the points.

\textbf{General Comment:} This question is testing if you can associate the models with their graphical representation. If you are having trouble, go back to the corresponding Core module to learn about the specific function you are having trouble recognizing.

\litem{
For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 50 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 14 \text{ percent} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 4 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
\item \( \text{About } 14 \text{ percent} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 22 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
\item \( \text{About } 25 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $190^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $16^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 10 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $126^{\circ}$ C. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = -0.07524 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.05465 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ correctly.
\item \( k = -0.05465 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.07632 \)

This uses $A$ correctly and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct answer as $k = -0.04586$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The initial temperature is when $t = 0$. Unlike power models, that means $A$ is not the initial temperature!

For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 34 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 10 \text{ percent} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 3 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
\item \( \text{About } 17 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 16 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
\item \( \text{About } 10 \text{ percent} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.

For the scenario below, find the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible).

\begin{center}
    \textit{ In an alternative galaxy, the quartic of the time, $T$ (Earth years), required for a planet to orbit Sun $\chi$ decreases as the cube of the distance, $d$ (AUs), that the planet is from Sun $\chi$ decreases. For example, when Ea's average distance from Sun $\chi$ is 8, it takes 74 Earth days to complete an orbit. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( k = 58567.531 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = 15353126912.000 \)

This corresponds to the model $T^{4} = \frac{k}{d^{3}}$.
\item \( k = 1.466 \)

This corresponds to the model $T^{1/4} = k d^{1/3}$.
\item \( k = 58567.531 \)

* This is the correct option corresponding to the model $T^{4} = k d^{3}$.
\item \( k = 4.028 \)

This copies the constant used in the homework.
\item \( \text{Unable to compute the constant based on the information given.} \)

This corresponds to believing you cannot determine the type of model from the information given.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Since $T$ decreases proportionally as $d$ decreases, we know this is a direct variation model.

Solve the modeling problem below, if possible.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ In CHM2045L, Brittany created a 29 liter 28 percent solution of chemical $\chi$ using two different solution percentages of chemical $\chi$. When she went to write her lab report, she realized she forgot to write the amount of each solution she used! If she remembers she used 16 percent and 43 percent solutions, what was the amount she used of the 16 percent solution? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( 16.11 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 14.50 \)

This would be correct if Brittany used equal parts of each solution.
\item \( 16.11 \)

*This is the correct option.
\item \( 12.89 \)

This is the concentration of 43 percent solution.
\item \( 12.63 \)

This was a random value. If this was not a guess, contact the coordinator to talk about how you got this value.
\item \( \text{There is not enough information to solve the problem.} \)

You may have chose this if you thought you needed to know how much of the second solution was used in the problem. Remember that the total minus the first solution would give you the second amount used.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Build the model exactly as you did in Module 9M. Then, solve for the volume you are looking for.
