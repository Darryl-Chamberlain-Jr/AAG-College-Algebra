To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 6 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{6}{x} - 1}{x - 6} \]The solution is \( \{ 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010, 6.0001 \} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010, 6.0001 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 5.9000, 5.9900, 5.9990, 5.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 6 on the left.
\item \( \{ 5.9000, 5.9900, 6.0100, 6.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 6.0000, 5.9000, 5.9900, 5.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 6 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 6.0000, 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 6 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\end{enumerate}

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ As $x$ approaches $\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $19.245$. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 19.245 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) \text{ is undefined when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( x \text{ is undefined when } f(x) \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 19.245 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \)


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $\infty$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(\infty)$!

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 3 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{x} - 1}{x - 3} \]The solution is \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990, 2.9999 \} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990, 2.9999 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 3.0100, 3.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 3.0000, 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 3 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.0000, 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 3 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010, 3.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 3 on the right.

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 8} \frac{\sqrt{8x - 48} - 4}{4x - 32} \]The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 0.125 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 0.707 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( 0.031 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.250.
