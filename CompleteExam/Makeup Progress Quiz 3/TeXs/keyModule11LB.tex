To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 3 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{x} - 1}{x - 3} \]

The solution is \( \{ 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010, 3.0001 \} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990, 2.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 3 on the left.
\item \( \{ 3.0000, 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 3 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010, 3.0001 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 3.0000, 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 3 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 3.0100, 3.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
