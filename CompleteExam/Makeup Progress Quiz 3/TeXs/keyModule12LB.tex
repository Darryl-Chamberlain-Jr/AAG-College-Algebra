Determine the vertical asymptotes and holes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{8x^{3} -26 x^{2} -5 x + 50}{8x^{2} +22 x + 15} \]

The solution is \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.5 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.25 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Holes at } x = -1.5 \text{ and } x = -1.25 \text{ with no vertical asymptotes.} \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as holes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.5 \text{ and } x = -1.25 \text{ with no holes.} \)

This corresponds to not factoring out the hole.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.5 \text{ and } x = 2.5 \text{ with a hole at } x = -1.25 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.5 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.25 \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.0 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.25 \)

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to factor the numerator and denominator. Any factors that cancel are holes in the function. The zeros left in the denominator are the vertical asymptotes.
