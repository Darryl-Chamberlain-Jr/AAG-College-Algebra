\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$.
\[ \frac{54 - 11 i}{-8 + 3 i} \]The solution is \( -6.37  - 1.01 i \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} $-5.47  + 3.42 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
 $-465.00  - 1.01 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
 $-6.37  - 74.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
 $-6.75  - 3.67 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
* $-6.37  - 1.01 i$, which is the correct option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.

Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$.
\[ \frac{-63 - 55 i}{-3 + 6 i} \]The solution is \( -3.13  + 12.07 i \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* $-3.13  + 12.07 i$, which is the correct option.
 $-141.00  + 12.07 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
 $11.53  - 4.73 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
 $-3.13  + 543.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
 $21.00  - 9.17 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.

What is the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to?
\[ \sqrt{\frac{361}{225}} + 25i^2 \]The solution is \( \text{Rational} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* This is the correct option!
This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.

\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$.
\[ (5 - 9 i)(2 + 8 i) \]The solution is \( 82 + 22 i \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} $82 - 22 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
 $-62 - 58 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
 $10 - 72 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
 $-62 + 58 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
* $82 + 22 i$, which is the correct option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.

\litem{
What is the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to?
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{1320}{10}} \]The solution is \( \text{Irrational} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
* This is the correct option!
These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-\sqrt{132}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.

Simplify the expression below.
\[ 14 - 10 \div 8 * 5 - (3 * 15) \]The solution is \( -37.250 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} -31.250, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
 58.750, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
 71.250, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
* -37.250, which is the correct option.
 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.

Simplify the expression below.
\[ 11 - 19^2 + 2 \div 9 * 8 \div 1 \]The solution is \( -348.222 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} 373.778, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
 -349.972, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
 372.028, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
