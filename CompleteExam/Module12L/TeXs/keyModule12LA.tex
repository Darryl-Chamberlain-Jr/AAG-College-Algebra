Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{3x^{2} -13 x + 12}{12x^{3} -25 x^{2} -18 x + 40} \]The solution is \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 0 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}This corresponds to using rule for Horizontal Asymptote when degree of numerator and denominator match.
* This is the correct option.
This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as horizontal asymptote.
This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote.
This corresponds to flipping the numerator and denominator, then using synthetic division to find the oblique asymptote.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a Horizontal Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to the degree of the denominator. We have an Oblique Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. We cannot have both!
