Is the graph below a linear function?

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../Figures/MA_8_F_1_2_graphY.png}
\end{center}


The solution is yes, the graph is linear., which is option A.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item Yes, the graph is linear

* Correct! The graph has a constant rate of change and is thus a linear function.
\item No, the graph is not linear.

A linear function has a constant rate of growth. As $x$ increases/decreases, $y$ increases/decreases at the same rate. The graph in this example does have a constant rate of change.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{General Comment:} The equation graphed was 4(x -2)+5. A linear function has a constant rate of growth. This means that as $x$ increases or decreases, $y$ increase or decreases at the same rate. For example, $x^2$ is NOT a linear function. As $x$ increases, the $y$ increases faster and faster. From $x=1$ to $x=2$, the $y$ increases by 3. From $x=2$ to $x=3$, the $y$ increases by 5. From $x=3$ to $x=4$, the $y$ increases by 7. A linear function would have the same change in $y$ for any change in $x$.

Is the following relation a function?
\[ (4, 0.12), (5, 0.06), (6, 0.03), (7, 0.02), (8, 0.01), (9, 0.0), (10, 0.0) \]The solution is Yes, which is option A.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item Yes

* Correct! Every $x$-value has exactly one output.
\item No

For a relation to be a function, every $x$-value needs exactly one output. That means for a relation to NOT be a function, we would need one $x$-value that has two or more different outputs.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{General Comment:} For a relation to be a function, every $x$-value needs exactly one output.

\litem{
Is the equation below a linear function?
\[ f(x) = 4(x + 5)-1 \]The solution is yes, the graph is linear., which is option A.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item Yes, the equation is linear

* Correct! The equation is a degree-1 polynomial and is thus a linear function.
\item No, the equation is not linear.

A linear function is a degree-1 polynomial. Polynomial equations have all variables with positive integer exponents.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{General Comment:} The equation graphed was 4(x + 5)-1. A linear function is a degree-1 polynomial. Polynomial equations have all variables with positive integer exponents, like $f(x) = 3x^2-2x+4$. Square root and cube root functions have rational exponents (1/2 and 1/3).

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item Yes

A linear function has a constant rate of growth. As $x$ increases/decreases, $y$ increases/decreases at the same rate. The table in this example does have a constant rate of change.
\item No

* Correct! The table in this example does not have a constant rate of change. This relation is a float function.
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{General Comment:} For a relation to be a linear function, every $x$-value needs exactly one output AND there needs to be a constant rate of growth (as $x$ increases/decreases, $y$ increases/decreases at the same rate).
