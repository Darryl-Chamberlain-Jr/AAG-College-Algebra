\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

First, find the equation of the line containing the two points below. Then, write the equation in the form $ y=mx+b $.
\[ (-7, -2) \text{ and } (-8, -11) \]The solution is \( y = 9.0x + 61.0 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* $y = 9.0x + 61.0$, which is the correct option.
 $y = 9.0x + 5$, which corresponds to using the correct slope/equation but not distributing correctly using the first point.
 $y = 9.0x -61.0$, which corresponds to using the correct slope and getting the negative y-intercept.
 $y = 9.0x -3$, which corresponds to using the correct slope/equation but not distributing correctly using the second point.
 $y = -9.0x -83.0$, which corresponds to using the negative slope and the correct equation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to keep your points in order when plugging in to the slope formula.

Find the equation of the line described below. Write the linear equation in the form $y=mx+b$.
\[ \text{Perpendicular to } 4 x - 9 y = 5 \text{ and passing through the point } (7, 4). \]The solution is \( y = -2.25x + 19.75 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} $y = -2.25x - 3.00$, which corresponds to correct slope and mis-distributing while simplifying to slope-intercept form.
 $y = -2.25x - 19.75$, which corresponds to using the correct slope and getting the negative $y$-intercept.
* $y = -2.25x + 19.75$, which is the correct option.
 $y = -0.44x + 19.75$, which corresponds to using the reciprocal slope $(1/m)$.
 $y = 2.25x - 11.75$, which corresponds to using the negative slope.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Parallel slope is the same and perpendicular slope is opposite reciprocal. Opposite reciprocal means flipping the fraction and changing the sign (positive to negative or negative to positive).

Solve the equation below.
\[ -11(7x -9) = -18(10x -12) \]The solution is \( x = 1.136 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

Corresponds to students thinking a fraction means there is no solution to the equation.

\textbf{General Comment:} The most common mistake on this question is to not distribute the negative in front of the second fraction correctly. The best way to avoid this is putting the numerator in parentheses, which will help you remember to distribute the negative correctly.

\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:} $x = -0.065$, which corresponds to dividing the second number in the numerator by the denominator rather than dividing BOTH parts of the numerator by the denominator (or removing the fractions through multiplication).

 $x = -63.226$, which corresponds to dividing the coefficients in front of x by the denominator rather than dividing BOTH parts of the numerator by the denominator (or removing the fractions through multiplication).
