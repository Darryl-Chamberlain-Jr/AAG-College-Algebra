\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textbf{If you have a suggestion to make the keys better, \href{https://forms.gle/CZkbZmPbC9XALEE88}{please fill out the short survey here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

1. Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
$$ 20 - 19^2 + 8 \div 11 * 6 \div 12 $$ 
The solution is $ -340.636 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [381.08, 381.44] $ 

  381.364000, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$ 
\item $ [-340.89, -340.19] $ 

 * -340.636000, this is the correct option 
\item $ [-341.1, -340.76] $ 

  -340.990000, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division. 
\item $ [380.13, 381.24] $ 

  381.010000, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors. 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

  You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.

-----------------------------------------------

2. Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
$$ \frac{-4}{-17}+\sqrt{-9}i $$ 
The solution is $ \text{Rational} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{Nonreal Complex} $ 

 This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number). 
\item $ \text{Rational} $ 

 These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5) 
\item $ \text{Irrational} $ 

 These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer! 
\item $ \text{Pure Imaginary} $ 

 This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$. 
\item $ \text{Not a Complex Number} $ 

 This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number! 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.

-----------------------------------------------

3. Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
$$ -\sqrt{\frac{15876}{441}} $$ 
The solution is $ \text{\text{Integer}} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{Rational} $ 

 These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3) 
\item $ \text{Not a Real number} $ 

 These are Nonreal Complex numbers OR things that are not numbers (dividing by 0). 
\item $ \text{Irrational} $ 

 These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. 
\item $ \text{Integer} $ 

 These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) 
\item $ \text{Whole} $ 

 These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-126$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.

-----------------------------------------------

4. Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
$$ \frac{9  + 22 i}{3  + 5 i} $$ 
The solution is $ 4.03  + 0.62 i $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ a \in [2.6, 3.09] \text{ and } b \in [4.34, 4.72] $ 

  $3.00  + 4.40 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second. 
\item $ a \in [3.45, 5.12] \text{ and } b \in [20.5, 22.03] $ 

  $4.03  + 21.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator. 
\item $ a \in [136.76, 137.25] \text{ and } b \in [-0.04, 0.71] $ 

  $137.00  + 0.62 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator. 
\item $ a \in [3.45, 5.12] \text{ and } b \in [-0.04, 0.71] $ 

 * $4.03  + 0.62 i$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ a \in [-2.81, -1.51] \text{ and } b \in [3.24, 3.4] $ 

  $-2.44  + 3.26 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comment: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.

-----------------------------------------------

5. Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
$$ (-8  + 5 i)(-4  + 2 i) $$ 
The solution is $ 22  - 36 i $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ a \in [36, 44] \text{ and } b \in [3, 7] $ 

  $42  + 4 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term. 
\item $ a \in [25, 37] \text{ and } b \in [5, 17] $ 

  $32  + 10 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part. 
\item $ a \in [16, 28] \text{ and } b \in [30, 40] $ 

  $22  + 36 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms. 
\item $ a \in [16, 28] \text{ and } b \in [-44, -31] $ 

 * $22  - 36 i$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ a \in [36, 44] \text{ and } b \in [-9, 0] $ 

  $42  - 4 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
