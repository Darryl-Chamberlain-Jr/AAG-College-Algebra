\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textbf{If you have a suggestion to make the keys better, \href{https://forms.gle/CZkbZmPbC9XALEE88}{please fill out the short survey here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

Write the equation of the graph presented below in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, assuming  $a=1$ or $a=-1$.

The solution is \( f(x) = x^{2} -4 x -2 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}$f(x)=x^{2} +4 x + 10$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2 - k$.
$f(x)=-x^{2} +4 x -10$, which corresponds to making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
$f(x)=x^{2} +4 x -2$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$.
* $f(x)=x^{2} -4 x -2$, which is the correct option.
$f(x)=-x^{2} -4 x -10$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$ AND making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When the graph is pointing up, $a=1$. When the graph is pointing down, $a=-1$. Be sure to use Vertex Form: $y = a(x-h)^2+k$.

Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.
