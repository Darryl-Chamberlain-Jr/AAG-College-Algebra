Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{6x^{3} -23 x^{2} -10 x + 75}{3x^{2} +17 x + 20} \]

The solution is \( y = 2x -19 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x -19. \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = -4.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x -19 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote AND mixing up horizontal/vertical asymoptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote at } y = -4.0 \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as horizontal asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 2.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x -19 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 2.0  \)

This corresponds to using rule for Horizontal Asymptote when degree of numerator and denominator match.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a Horizontal Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to the degree of the denominator. We have an Oblique Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. We cannot have both!
