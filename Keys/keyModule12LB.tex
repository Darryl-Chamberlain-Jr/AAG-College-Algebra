Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{12x^{3} +41 x^{2} -40 x -48}{4x^{2} -13 x -12} \]The solution is \( y = 3x + 20 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Oblique Asymptote of } y = 3x + 20. \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 4.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 3x + 20 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote AND mixing up horizontal/vertical asymoptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 3x + 20 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote at } y = 4.0 \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as horizontal asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.0  \)

This corresponds to using rule for Horizontal Asymptote when degree of numerator and denominator match.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a Horizontal Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to the degree of the denominator. We have an Oblique Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. We cannot have both!

The solution is \( f(x)=\frac{x^{3} + x^{2} -4 x -4}{x^{3} +12 x^{2} +41 x + 30} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x)=\frac{x^{3} +4 x^{2} -4 x -16}{x^{3} +12 x^{2} +41 x + 30} \)

You treated all of the zeros in the denominator as vertical asymptotes when some of them were holes!
\item \( f(x)=\frac{x^{3} + x^{2} -4 x -4}{x^{3} +12 x^{2} +41 x + 30} \)

This is the correct answer!
\item \( f(x)=\frac{x^{3} -1 x^{2} -4 x + 4}{x^{3} -12 x^{2} +41 x -30} \)

You treated all of the zeros in the denominator as vertical asmptotes when some of them were holes and wrote factors as $x+z$.
\item \( f(x)=\frac{x^{3} -1 x^{2} -4 x + 4}{x^{3} -12 x^{2} +41 x -30} \)

Remember that factors are written as $x-z$. For example, the zero $x=-6$ corresponds to the factor $x-(-6)$.
\item \( \text{None of the above are possible equations for the graph.} \)

If you believe none of the functions above could be the graph, please contact the coordinator.

\textbf{General Comment:} We want to factor the numerator and denominator to determine which zeros in the denominator are vertical asympototes and which are holes.

Determine the vertical asymptotes and holes in the rational function below.

\item \( \text{Holes at } x = -1.333 \text{ and } x = -0.75 \text{ with no vertical asymptotes.} \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as holes.

This corresponds to not factoring out the hole.

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.0 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.75 \)

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.333 \text{ and } x = 0.667 \text{ with a hole at } x = -0.75 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to factor the numerator and denominator. Any factors that cancel are holes in the function. The zeros left in the denominator are the vertical asymptotes.
