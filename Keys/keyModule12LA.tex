Determine the vertical asymptotes and holes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{12x^{3} +23 x^{2} -8 x -12}{9x^{2} -9 x -10} \]

The solution is \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.667 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.667 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Holes at } x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = -0.667 \text{ with no vertical asymptotes.} \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as holes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = 0.75 \text{ with a hole at } x = -0.667 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.667 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.667 \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.333 \text{ and hole at } x = -0.667 \)

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = -0.667 \text{ with no holes.} \)

This corresponds to not factoring out the hole.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to factor the numerator and denominator. Any factors that cancel are holes in the function. The zeros left in the denominator are the vertical asymptotes.

\litem{
Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x^{2} -x -6}{10x^{3} +33 x^{2} +35 x + 12} \]

This corresponds to flipping the numerator and denominator, then using synthetic division to find the oblique asymptote.
