\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textbf{If you have a suggestion to make the keys better, \href{https://forms.gle/CZkbZmPbC9XALEE88}{please fill out the short survey here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately.

36. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ \log_{5}{(2x+5)}+4 = 2 \] 
The solution is $ x = -2.480 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-5, -2] $ 

 * $x = -2.480$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-20, -14] $ 

 $x = -18.500$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting. 
\item $ x \in [7, 14] $ 

 $x = 10.000$, which corresponds to ignoring the vertical shift when converting to exponential form. 
\item $ x \in [-14, -10] $ 

 $x = -13.500$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting and reversing the value with $x$. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing a negative coefficient within the log equation means there is no Real solution. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} First, get the equation in the form $\log_b{(cx+d)} = a$. Then, convert to $b^a = cx+d$ and solve.

-----------------------------------------------

37. Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -\log_2{(x-3)}+1 \] 
The solution is $ (\infty, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [-4.27, -2.69] $ 

 $[-3, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative of the horizontal shift AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-0.5, 2.81] $ 

 $(-\infty, 1)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift while the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-1.77, 0.12] $ 

 $(-\infty, -1)$, which corresponds to using the using the negative of vertical shift on $(0, \infty)$. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [2.95, 3.66] $ 

 $[1, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the flipped Domain AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 *This is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.

-----------------------------------------------

38.  Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains $x$ (if it exists).
\[  15 = \ln{\sqrt[4]{\frac{16}{e^{3x}}}} \] 
The solution is $ x = -19.076, \text{ which does not fit in any of the interval options.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-8, -1] $ 

 $x = -4.535$, which corresponds to thinking you need to take the natural log of the left side before reducing. 
\item $ x \in [18, 22] $ 

 $x = 19.076$, which is the negative of the correct solution. 
\item $ x \in [-11, -8] $ 

 $x = -9.076$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 *$x = -19.076$ is the correct solution and does not fit in any of the other intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(16)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.

-----------------------------------------------

39. Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = e^{x-5}-8 \] 
The solution is $ (-8, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [-10, -1] $ 

 * $(-8, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [-10, -1] $ 

 $[-8, \infty)$, which corresponds to including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-1, 13] $ 

 $(-\infty, 8)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [-1, 13] $ 

 $(-\infty, 8]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 This corresponds to confusing range of an exponential function with the domain of an exponential function. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.

-----------------------------------------------

40. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ 5^{-3x-2} = 27^{-2x+5} \] 
The solution is $ x = 11.171 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [9, 13] $ 

 * $x = 11.171$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-10, -2] $ 

 $x = -7.000$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different. 
\item $ x \in [-22, -19] $ 

 $x = -19.698$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only. 
\item $ x \in [3, 6] $ 

 $x = 3.970$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.
