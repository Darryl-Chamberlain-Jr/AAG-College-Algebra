36. Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -e^{x-1}+4 \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 4) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [-12, 0] $ 

 $[-4, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [-12, 0] $ 

 $(-4, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [3, 8] $ 

 $(-\infty, 4]$, which corresponds to including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [3, 8] $ 

 * $(-\infty, 4)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 This corresponds to confusing range of an exponential function with the domain of an exponential function. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.

-----------------------------------------------

37. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ 3^{5x-2} = 64^{3x+3} \] 
The solution is $ x = -2.101 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-5, -1] $ 

 * $x = -2.101$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [1, 5] $ 

 $x = 2.500$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different. 
\item $ x \in [-1, 1] $ 

 $x = -0.716$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only. 
\item $ x \in [6, 9] $ 

 $x = 7.337$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.

-----------------------------------------------

38.  Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains $x$ (if it exists).
\[  11 = \sqrt[6]{\frac{14}{e^{9x}}} \] 
The solution is $ x = -1.305, \text{ which does not fit in any of the interval options.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-0.95, -0.03] $ 

 $x = -0.240$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root. 
\item $ x \in [-7.88, -6.75] $ 

 $x = -7.627$, which corresponds to thinking you don't need to take the natural log of both sides before reducing, as if the right side already has a natural log. 
\item $ x \in [0.27, 1.62] $ 

 $x = 1.305$, which is the negative of the correct solution. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 * $x = -1.305$ is the correct solution and does not fit in any of the other intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(14)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.

-----------------------------------------------

39. Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = \log_2{(x-8)}-4 \] 
The solution is $ (8, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-9.1, -5.8] $ 

 $(-\infty, -8)$, which corresponds to flipping the Domain. Remember: the general for is $a*\log(x-h)+k$, \textbf{where $a$ does not affect the domain}. 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [4.9, 10.7] $ 

 * $(8, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [1.3, 5.2] $ 

 $(-\infty, 4]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND including the endpoint AND flipping the domain. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [-4.4, -3.8] $ 

 $[-4, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift when shifting the Domain AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 This corresponds to thinking of the range of the log function (or the domain of the exponential function). 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.

-----------------------------------------------

40. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ \log_{5}{(-3x+8)}+5 = 3 \] 
The solution is $ x = 2.653 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [13, 16] $ 

 $x = 13.333$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting. 
\item $ x \in [-47, -34] $ 

 $x = -39.000$, which corresponds to ignoring the vertical shift when converting to exponential form. 
\item $ x \in [3, 11] $ 

 $x = 8.000$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting and reversing the value with $x$. 
\item $ x \in [0, 7] $ 

 * $x = 2.653$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing a negative coefficient within the log equation means there is no Real solution. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} First, get the equation in the form $\log_b{(cx+d)} = a$. Then, convert to $b^a = cx+d$ and solve.
