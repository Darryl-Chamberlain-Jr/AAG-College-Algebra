71. For the graph below, find the value(s) $a$ that makes the limit true: $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ does not exist.
\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Figures/evaluateLimitGraphicallyA.png} \end{center} 

The solution is $ 1 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ 1 $ 

  
\item $ 3 $ 

  
\item $ -2 $ 

  
\item $ \text{Multiple } a \text{ make the limit true}. $ 

  
\item $ \text{No } a \text{ make the limit true}. $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} Remember that the limit does not exist if the left-hand and right-hand limits do not match.

-----------------------------------------------

72. Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?
$f(x)$ approaches $13.42$ as $x$ approaches $\infty$. 
The solution is $ f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 13.42 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 13.42 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. $ 

  
\item $ x \text{ is undefined when } f(x) \text{ is large enough}. $ 

  
\item $ f(x) \text{ is undefined when } x \text{ is large enough}. $ 

  
\item $ f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. $ 

  
\item $ \text{None of the above are always true.} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General comments:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $\infty$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(x)$!

-----------------------------------------------

73. To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 6 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{6}{x} - 1}{x - 6} \] 
The solution is $ \{ 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010, 6.0001 \} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \{ 6.0000, 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010 \} $ 

 If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 6 doesn't help us estimate the limit. 
\item $ \{ 5.9000, 5.9900, 6.0100, 6.1000 \} $ 

 These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit. 
\item $ \{ 6.0000, 5.9000, 5.9900, 5.9990 \} $ 

 If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 6 doesn't help us estimate the limit. 
\item $ \{ 5.9000, 5.9900, 5.9990, 5.9999 \} $ 

 These values would estimate the limit of 6 on the left. 
\item $ \{ 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010, 6.0001 \} $ 

 This is correct! 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

-----------------------------------------------

74. Evaluate the one-sided limit of the function $f(x)$ below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow -1^+} \frac{8}{(x+1)^4}+6 \] 
The solution is $ \infty $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ f(-1) $ 

  
\item $ -\infty $ 

  
\item $ \infty $ 

  
\item $ \text{The limit does not exist} $ 

  
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General comments:} You should be able to graph the rational function displayed. If not, go back to Module 7 to learn about the general shape of rational functions.

-----------------------------------------------

75. Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 8} \frac{\sqrt{7x - 20} - 6}{4x - 32} \] 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \infty $ 

 You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity. 
\item $ 0.661 $ 

 You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials. 
\item $ 0.083 $ 

 You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here. 
\item $ 0.021 $ 

 You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here. 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 * This is the correct option as the limit is 0.146. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 8$.
