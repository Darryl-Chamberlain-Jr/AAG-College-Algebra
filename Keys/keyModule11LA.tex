\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 9} \frac{\sqrt{5x - 9} - 6}{9x - 81} \]

The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 0.248 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( 0.009 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( 0.083 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.046.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 9$.
}
\litem{
For the graph below, find the value(s) $a$ that makes the statement true: $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = 3$.

The solution is \( \text{Multiple } a \text{ make the statement true}. \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 1 \)


\item \( -\infty \)


\item \( -2 \)


\item \( \text{Multiple } a \text{ make the statement true}. \)


\item \( \text{No } a \text{ make the statement true}. \)


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} There can be multiple $a$ values that make the statement true! For the limit, draw a horizontal line and determine if an $x$ value makes the limit exist.
}
\litem{
Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?
\[ As $x$ approaches $\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $9.976$. \]

The solution is \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is undefined when } f(x) \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 9.976 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is undefined when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \)


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $\infty$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(x)$!

\litem{
To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 3 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{x} - 1}{x - 3} \]

The solution is \( \{ 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010, 3.0001 \} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 3.0100, 3.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 3.0000, 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 3 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010, 3.0001 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990, 2.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 3 on the left.
\item \( \{ 3.0000, 3.1000, 3.0100, 3.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 3 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 8} \frac{\sqrt{6x - 32} - 4}{8x - 64} \]

The solution is \( 0.094 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 0.094 \)

\item \( 0.016 \)

If you got a limit that does not match any of the above, please contact the coordinator.
