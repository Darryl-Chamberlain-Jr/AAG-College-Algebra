61. Determine whether the function below is 1-1.
\[ f(x) = (3 x + 18)^3 \] 
The solution is $ \text{yes} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{No, because there is a $y$-value that goes to 2 different $x$-values.} $ 

 Corresponds to the Horizontal Line test, which this function passes. 
\item $ \text{No, because there is an $x$-value that goes to 2 different $y$-values.} $ 

 Corresponds to the Vertical Line test, which checks if an expression is a function. 
\item $ \text{Yes, the function is 1-1.} $ 

 * This is the solution. 
\item $ \text{No, because the range of the function is not $(-\infty, \infty)$.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing 1-1 means the range is all Real numbers. 
\item $ \text{No, because the domain of the function is not $(-\infty, \infty)$.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing 1-1 means the domain is all Real numbers. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} There are only two valid options: The function is 1-1 OR No because there is a $y$-value that goes to 2 different $x$-values.

-----------------------------------------------

62. Choose the interval below that $f$ composed with $g$ at $x=1$ is in.
\[ f(x) = -2x^{3} +3 x^{2} -2 x + 4 \text{ and } g(x) = 3x^{3} -1 x^{2} -4 x \] 
The solution is $ 36.0 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (f \circ g)(1) \in [58, 61] $ 

  Distractor 1: Corresponds to reversing the composition. 
\item $ (f \circ g)(1) \in [33, 38] $ 

 * This is the correct solution 
\item $ (f \circ g)(1) \in [27, 32] $ 

  Distractor 2: Corresponds to being slightly off from the solution. 
\item $ (f \circ g)(1) \in [65, 75] $ 

  Distractor 3: Corresponds to being slightly off from the solution. 
\item $ \text{It is not possible to compose the two functions.} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: $f$ composed with $g$ at $x$ means $f(g(x))$. The order matters!

-----------------------------------------------

63. Find the inverse of the function below. Then, evaluate the inverse at $x = 9$ and choose the interval that $f^{-1}(9)$ belongs to.
\[ f(x) = \ln{(x-4)}-2 \] 
The solution is $ f^{-1}(9) = 59878.142 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ f^{-1}(9) \in [59865, 59875] $ 

  This solution corresponds to distractor 3. 
\item $ f^{-1}(9) \in [442410, 442413] $ 

  This solution corresponds to distractor 2. 
\item $ f^{-1}(9) \in [144, 150] $ 

  This solution corresponds to distractor 4. 
\item $ f^{-1}(9) \in [59876, 59889] $ 

  This is the solution. 
\item $ f^{-1}(9) \in [1095, 1101] $ 

  This solution corresponds to distractor 1. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
Natural log and exponential functions always have an inverse. Once you switch the $x$ and $y$, use the conversion $ e^y = x \leftrightarrow y=\ln(x)$.

-----------------------------------------------

64. Find the inverse of the function below (if it exists). Then, evaluate the inverse at $x = 11$ and choose the interval that $f^{-1}(11)$ belongs to.
\[ f(x) = 2 x^2 - 4 \] 
The solution is $ \text{ The function is not invertible for all Real numbers. } $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ f^{-1}(11) \in [4.53, 5.21] $ 

  Distractor 4: This corresponds to both distractors 2 and 3. 
\item $ f^{-1}(11) \in [3.22, 3.77] $ 

  Distractor 3: This corresponds to finding the (nonexistent) inverse and dividing by a negative. 
\item $ f^{-1}(11) \in [1.5, 1.96] $ 

  Distractor 2: This corresponds to finding the (nonexistent) inverse and not subtracting by the vertical shift. 
\item $ f^{-1}(11) \in [2.07, 3.59] $ 

  Distractor 1: This corresponds to trying to find the inverse even though the function is not 1-1.  
\item $ \text{ The function is not invertible for all Real numbers. } $ 

 * This is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Be sure you check that the function is 1-1 before trying to find the inverse!

-----------------------------------------------

65. Subtract the following functions, then choose the domain of the resulting function from the list below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{5x-19} \text{ and } g(x) = 5x^{2} +8 x + 2 \] 
The solution is $ \text{ The domain is all Real numbers except } x = 3.8 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{ The domain is all Real numbers greater than or equal to } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-8, -2] $ 

  
\item $ \text{ The domain is all Real numbers less than or equal to } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-8, 1] $ 

  
\item $ \text{ The domain is all Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [0, 8] $ 

  
\item $ \text{ The domain is all Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [4, 14] \text{ and } b \in [2, 12] $ 

  
\item $ \text{ The domain is all Real numbers. } $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: The new domain is the intersection of the previous domains.
