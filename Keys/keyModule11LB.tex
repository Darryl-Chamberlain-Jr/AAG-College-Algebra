\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 9} \frac{\sqrt{7x - 14} - 7}{2x - 18} \]

The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 0.071 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( 0.036 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( 1.323 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.250.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 9$.

\litem{
To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 8 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{8}{x} - 1}{x - 8} \]

The solution is \( \{ 7.9000, 7.9900, 7.9990, 7.9999 \} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 8.1000, 8.0100, 8.0010, 8.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 8 on the right.
\item \( \{ 7.9000, 7.9900, 8.0100, 8.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 7.9000, 7.9900, 7.9990, 7.9999 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 8.0000, 8.1000, 8.0100, 8.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 8 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 8.0000, 7.9000, 7.9900, 7.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 8 doesn't help us estimate the limit.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 4 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{4}{x} - 1}{x - 4} \]

The solution is \( \{ 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010, 4.0001 \} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
