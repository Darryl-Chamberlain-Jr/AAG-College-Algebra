Evaluate $f$ composed with $g$ at $x=1$.

 Distractor 1: Corresponds to reversing the composition.
 Distractor 3: Corresponds to being slightly off from the solution.
 Distractor 2: Corresponds to being slightly off from the solution.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} $f$ composed with $g$ at $x$ means $f(g(x))$. The order matters!
