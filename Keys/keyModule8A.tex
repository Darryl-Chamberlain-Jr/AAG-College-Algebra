36. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ 5^{-4x-5} = 16^{-3x+4} \] 
The solution is $ x = 10.179 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [9, 12] $ 

 * $x = 10.179$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [1, 5] $ 

 $x = 4.787$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only. 
\item $ x \in [-10, -8] $ 

 $x = -9.000$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different. 
\item $ x \in [-21, -17] $ 

 $x = -19.138$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.

-----------------------------------------------

37. Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -\log_2{(x+1)}+3 \] 
The solution is $ (-1, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [1.99, 4.45] $ 

 $[3, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift when shifting the Domain AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [-4.13, -2.94] $ 

 $(-\infty, -3]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND including the endpoint AND flipping the domain. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-0.12, 1.99] $ 

 $(-\infty, 1)$, which corresponds to flipping the Domain. Remember: the general for is $a*\log(x-h)+k$, \textbf{where $a$ does not affect the domain}. 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [-2.12, -0.02] $ 

 * $(-1, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 This corresponds to thinking of the range of the log function (or the domain of the exponential function). 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.

-----------------------------------------------

38. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ \log_{5}{(2x+5)}+5 = 2 \] 
The solution is $ x = -2.496 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-4, -2] $ 

 * $x = -2.496$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-128, -121] $ 

 $x = -124.000$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting. 
\item $ x \in [7, 12] $ 

 $x = 10.000$, which corresponds to ignoring the vertical shift when converting to exponential form. 
\item $ x \in [-122, -113] $ 

 $x = -119.000$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting and reversing the value with $x$. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing a negative coefficient within the log equation means there is no Real solution. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} First, get the equation in the form $\log_b{(cx+d)} = a$. Then, convert to $b^a = cx+d$ and solve.

-----------------------------------------------

39. Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = e^{x+7}+6 \] 
The solution is $ (6, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [-8, -4] $ 

 $(-\infty, -6]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [3, 9] $ 

 $[6, \infty)$, which corresponds to including the endpoint. 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [3, 9] $ 

 * $(6, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-8, -4] $ 

 $(-\infty, -6)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 This corresponds to confusing range of an exponential function with the domain of an exponential function. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.

-----------------------------------------------

40.  Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains $x$ (if it exists).
\[  7 = \ln{\sqrt[5]{\frac{6}{e^{8x}}}} \] 
The solution is $ x = -4.151 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-1.6, -1.5] $ 

 $x = -1.526$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root. 
\item $ x \in [-4.22, -4.11] $ 

 * $x = -4.151$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-1.49, -1.38] $ 

 $x = -1.440$, which corresponds to thinking you need to take the natural log of on the left before reducing. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 This corresponds to making an unexpected error. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(6)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.
