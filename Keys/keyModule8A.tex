36. Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -e^{x+7}+3 \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [-1, 5] $ 

 $(-\infty, 3]$, which corresponds to using the correct vertical shift *if we wanted the Range* AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [-4, 0] $ 

 $(-3, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-1, 5] $ 

 $(-\infty, 3)$, which corresponds to using the correct vertical shift *if we wanted the Range*. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [-4, 0] $ 

 $[-3, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 * This is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.

-----------------------------------------------

37. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ \log_{4}{(-4x+7)}+4 = 2 \] 
The solution is $ x = 1.734 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-3.5, -0.5] $ 

 $x = -2.250$, which corresponds to ignoring the vertical shift when converting to exponential form. 
\item $ x \in [0.8, 6.2] $ 

 * $x = 1.734$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-3.5, -0.5] $ 

 $x = -2.250$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting. 
\item $ x \in [-6.3, -3.4] $ 

 $x = -5.750$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting and reversing the value with $x$. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing a negative coefficient within the log equation means there is no Real solution. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} First, get the equation in the form $\log_b{(cx+d)} = a$. Then, convert to $b^a = cx+d$ and solve.

-----------------------------------------------

38. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ 5^{5x+5} = 9^{3x-3} \] 
The solution is $ x = -10.058 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-11.6, -9.3] $ 

 * $x = -10.058$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-5.6, -4.6] $ 

 $x = -5.496$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only. 
\item $ x \in [-5.1, -2.9] $ 

 $x = -4.000$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different. 
\item $ x \in [-8.7, -6.5] $ 

 $x = -7.319$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.

-----------------------------------------------

39. Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = \log_2{(x-8)}+5 \] 
The solution is $ (\infty, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [-8.9, -5.9] $ 

 $[-8, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative of the horizontal shift AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [2.6, 7.6] $ 

 $(-\infty, 5)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift while the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-5.1, -4.7] $ 

 $(-\infty, -5)$, which corresponds to using the using the negative of vertical shift on $(0, \infty)$. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [7.1, 10.2] $ 

 $[5, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the flipped Domain AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 *This is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.

-----------------------------------------------

40.  Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains $x$ (if it exists).
\[  15 = \sqrt[6]{\frac{10}{e^{5x}}} \] 
The solution is $ x = -2.789 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-19, -14] $ 

 $x = -18.461$, which corresponds to thinking you don't need to take the natural log of both sides before reducing, as if the equation already had a natural log on the right side. 
\item $ x \in [-1, 2] $ 

 $x = -0.623$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root. 
\item $ x \in [-4, -2] $ 

 * $x = -2.789$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 This corresponds to making an unexpected error. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(10)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.
