\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately.

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 19 - 5^2 + 17 \div 7 * 2 \div 15 \]
The solution is \( -5.676 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [43.91, 44.27] \)

 44.081, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [-6.39, -5.82] \)

 -5.919, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [-5.89, -5.29] \)

* -5.676, this is the correct option
\item \( [44.31, 44.75] \)

 44.324, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
