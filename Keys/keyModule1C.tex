1. Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{32400}{324}} \] 
The solution is $ \text{Whole} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{Integer} $ 

 These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) 
\item $ \text{Rational} $ 

 These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3) 
\item $ \text{Not a Real number} $ 

 These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0). 
\item $ \text{Irrational} $ 

 These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. 
\item $ \text{Whole} $ 

 * This is the correct option! 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $180$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational. 

-----------------------------------------------

2. Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-10  - 4 i)(-3  + 8 i) \] 
The solution is $ 62  - 68 i $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ a \in [27, 32] \text{ and } b \in [-39, -27] $ 

  $30  - 32 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part. 
\item $ a \in [-5, 1] \text{ and } b \in [89, 96] $ 

  $-2  + 92 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term. 
\item $ a \in [-5, 1] \text{ and } b \in [-97, -90] $ 

  $-2  - 92 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term. 
\item $ a \in [61, 63] \text{ and } b \in [64, 73] $ 

  $62  + 68 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms. 
\item $ a \in [61, 63] \text{ and } b \in [-74, -66] $ 

 * $62  - 68 i$, which is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute. 

-----------------------------------------------

3. Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 19 - 4^2 + 17 \div 11 * 3 \div 15 \] 
The solution is $ 3.309 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [2.89, 3.09] $ 

  3.034000, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division. 
\item $ [35.07, 35.37] $ 

  35.309000, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$ 
\item $ [3.28, 3.57] $ 

 * 3.309000, this is the correct option 
\item $ [34.92, 35.1] $ 

  35.034000, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors. 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

  You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right. 

-----------------------------------------------

4. Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{0}{6}}+\sqrt{4}i \] 
The solution is $ \text{Pure Imaginary} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{Rational} $ 

 These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5) 
\item $ \text{Nonreal Complex} $ 

 This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number). 
\item $ \text{Pure Imaginary} $ 

 This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$. 
\item $ \text{Not a Complex Number} $ 

 This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number! 
\item $ \text{Irrational} $ 

 These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer! 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section. 

-----------------------------------------------

5. Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{-54 + 44 i}{-5 - 2 i} \] 
The solution is $ 6.28  - 11.31 i $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ a \in [12.25, 12.85] \text{ and } b \in [-4.5, -2] $ 

  $12.34  - 3.86 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly. 
\item $ a \in [181.4, 182.75] \text{ and } b \in [-12.5, -10.5] $ 

  $182.00  - 11.31 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator. 
\item $ a \in [6.2, 7.05] \text{ and } b \in [-330, -326] $ 

  $6.28  - 328.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator. 
\item $ a \in [9.45, 12.05] \text{ and } b \in [-23, -20.5] $ 

  $10.80  - 22.00 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second. 
\item $ a \in [6.2, 7.05] \text{ and } b \in [-12.5, -10.5] $ 

 * $6.28  - 11.31 i$, which is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
