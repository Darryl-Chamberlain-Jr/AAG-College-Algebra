\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textbf{If you have a suggestion to make the keys better, \href{https://forms.gle/CZkbZmPbC9XALEE88}{please fill out the short survey here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

1. Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 2 - 14^2 + 10 \div 8 * 7 \div 15 \] 
The solution is $ -193.417 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [-193.9, -192.74] $ 

 * -193.417000, this is the correct option 
\item $ [197.02, 198.21] $ 

  198.012000, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors. 
\item $ [-194.43, -193.68] $ 

  -193.988000, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division. 
\item $ [198.41, 199.08] $ 

  198.583000, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$ 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

  You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.

-----------------------------------------------

2. Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \frac{\sqrt{90}}{5}+\sqrt{-4}i \] 
The solution is $ \text{Irrational} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{Rational} $ 

 These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5) 
\item $ \text{Not a Complex Number} $ 

 This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number! 
\item $ \text{Irrational} $ 

 These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer! 
\item $ \text{Pure Imaginary} $ 

 This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$. 
\item $ \text{Nonreal Complex} $ 

 This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number). 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.

-----------------------------------------------

3. Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{14400}{64}} \] 
The solution is $ \text{\text{Integer}} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{Not a Real number} $ 

 These are Nonreal Complex numbers OR things that are not numbers (dividing by 0). 
\item $ \text{Irrational} $ 

 These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. 
\item $ \text{Integer} $ 

 These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) 
\item $ \text{Whole} $ 

 These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) 
\item $ \text{Rational} $ 

 These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3) 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-120$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.

-----------------------------------------------

4. Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-5  + 3 i)(9  - 6 i) \] 
The solution is $ -27  + 57 i $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ a \in [-28, -25] \text{ and } b \in [54, 60] $ 

 * $-27  + 57 i$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ a \in [-64, -62] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 1] $ 

  $-63  - 3 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term. 
\item $ a \in [-64, -62] \text{ and } b \in [0, 6] $ 

  $-63  + 3 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term. 
\item $ a \in [-28, -25] \text{ and } b \in [-60, -55] $ 

  $-27  - 57 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms. 
\item $ a \in [-52, -43] \text{ and } b \in [-23, -16] $ 

  $-45  - 18 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.

-----------------------------------------------

5. Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{9  - 44 i}{-6  + 2 i} \] 
The solution is $ -3.55  + 6.15 i $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ a \in [-0.7, 2.6] \text{ and } b \in [6.5, 7.3] $ 

  $0.85  + 7.05 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly. 
\item $ a \in [-143.2, -138.8] \text{ and } b \in [5.7, 6.9] $ 

  $-142.00  + 6.15 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator. 
\item $ a \in [-1.6, 0.6] \text{ and } b \in [-24.8, -20.6] $ 

  $-1.50  - 22.00 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second. 
\item $ a \in [-5, -3.2] \text{ and } b \in [5.7, 6.9] $ 

 * $-3.55  + 6.15 i$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ a \in [-5, -3.2] \text{ and } b \in [245.9, 248] $ 

  $-3.55  + 246.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comment: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
