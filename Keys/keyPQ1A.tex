\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{54 + 77 i}{-1 + 4 i} \]
The solution is \( [14.941176470588236, -17.235294117647058] \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-56, -53.5] \text{ and } b \in [19, 21] \) $-54.00  + 19.25 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [14.5, 17] \text{ and } b \in [-294.5, -292] \) $14.94  - 293.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [-22, -19.5] \text{ and } b \in [8, 8.5] \) $-21.29  + 8.18 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [14.5, 17] \text{ and } b \in [-18.5, -15.5] \)* $14.94  - 17.24 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [253.5, 255.5] \text{ and } b \in [-18.5, -15.5] \) $254.00  - 17.24 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.

\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (2 - 6 i)(10 + 4 i) \]
The solution is \( 44 - 52 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-11, -3] \text{ and } b \in [-72, -62] \) $-4 - 68 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [38, 49] \text{ and } b \in [-52, -45] \)* $44 - 52 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [16, 22] \text{ and } b \in [-24, -23] \) $20 - 24 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [38, 49] \text{ and } b \in [50, 53] \) $44 + 52 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-11, -3] \text{ and } b \in [68, 71] \) $-4 + 68 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
