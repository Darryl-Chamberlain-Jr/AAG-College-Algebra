11. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ Less than } 8 \text{ units from the number } 1. $$ 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, 7] \cup [9, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 1 from 8 
\item $ (-\infty, 7) \cup (9, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 1 from 8 
\item $ [7, 9] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 1 from 8 
\item $ (7, 9) $ 

 This describes the values less than 1 from 8 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 Options A-D described the values [more/less than] 1 units from 8, which is the reverse of what the question asked. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -5 + 3 x < \frac{49 x + 6}{9} \leq 3 + 5 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-2.32, 5.25] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3, -2] \text{ and } b \in [1, 11] $ 

 $(-\infty, -2.32) \cup [5.25, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-5, 0] \text{ and } b \in [3, 11] $ 

 $[-2.32, 5.25)$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3, 2] \text{ and } b \in [4, 8] $ 

 $(-\infty, -2.32] \cup (5.25, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-6, 0] \text{ and } b \in [1, 12] $ 

 * $(-2.32, 5.25]$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -5 + 6 x > 7 x \text{ or } 4 + 5 x < 8 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -5.0) \text{ or } (1.333, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.3, 0.8] \text{ and } b \in [2.7, 5.3] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-6, -3.2] \text{ and } b \in [0.4, 3.5] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2, 0.1] \text{ and } b \in [4, 8] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5.4, -4] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 4] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{-7}{2} - \frac{8}{9} x \geq \frac{-6}{7} x + \frac{3}{3} $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -141.75] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [141, 144] $ 

  $(-\infty, 141.75]$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-143, -138] $ 

 * $(-\infty, -141.75]$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-144, -141] $ 

  $[-141.75, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [137, 144] $ 

  $[141.75, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -8x + 3 > -3x + 5 $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -0.4) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-0.96, -0.35] $ 

 * $(-\infty, -0.4)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0.29, 1.59] $ 

  $(0.4, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1.4, -0.33] $ 

  $(-0.4, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [0.2, 0.71] $ 

  $(-\infty, 0.4)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.
