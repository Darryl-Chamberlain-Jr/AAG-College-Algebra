11. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -8x + 4 < 3x + 3 $$ 
The solution is $ (0.091, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.02, 0.78] $ 

 * $(0.091, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.31, -0.03] $ 

  $(-0.091, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-0.42, -0.09] $ 

  $(-\infty, -0.091)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [0, 0.12] $ 

  $(-\infty, 0.091)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -6 - 5 x \leq \frac{-19 x - 7}{8} < 3 - 3 x $$ 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [1, 5] \text{ and } b \in [-12, -4] $ 

 $[1.95, -6.20)$, which is the correct interval but negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 6] \text{ and } b \in [-8, -1] $ 

 $(-\infty, 1.95) \cup [-6.20, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality AND getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [0, 6] \text{ and } b \in [-9, -4] $ 

 $(1.95, -6.20]$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 7] \text{ and } b \in [-9, -2] $ 

 $(-\infty, 1.95] \cup (-6.20, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 * This is correct as the answer should be $[-1.95, 6.20)$. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{-8}{4} - \frac{9}{6} x \geq \frac{-4}{9} x - \frac{10}{3} $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 1.263] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [0.1, 2] $ 

 * $(-\infty, 1.263]$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-2.8, -0.8] $ 

  $(-\infty, -1.263]$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-6, 1] $ 

  $[-1.263, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 9] $ 

  $[1.263, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No less than } 4 \text{ units from the number } 3. $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -1] \cup [7, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, -1) \cup (7, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 4 from 3 
\item $ [-1, 7] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 4 from 3 
\item $ (-\infty, -1] \cup [7, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 4 from 3 
\item $ (-1, 7) $ 

 This describes the values less than 4 from 3 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 You likely thought the values in the interval were not correct. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -9 + 5 x > 6 x \text{ or } -4 + 9 x < 12 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -9.0) \text{ or } (-1.333, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-13, -6] \text{ and } b \in [-3, 2] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-12, -7] \text{ and } b \in [-6, 2] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 4] \text{ and } b \in [5, 14] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [1, 5] \text{ and } b \in [7, 10] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.
