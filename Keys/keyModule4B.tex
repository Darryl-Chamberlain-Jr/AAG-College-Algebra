\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

Write the equation of the graph presented below in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, assuming  $a=1$ or $a=-1$.

\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}$f(x)=-x^{2} -8 x -22$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$.
$f(x)=x^{2} +8 x + 10$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$ AND making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
* $f(x)=-x^{2} +8 x -22$, which is the correct option.
$f(x)=x^{2} -8 x + 10$, which corresponds to making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
$f(x)=-x^{2} -8 x -10$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2 - k$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When the graph is pointing up, $a=1$. When the graph is pointing down, $a=-1$. Be sure to use Vertex Form: $y = a(x-h)^2+k$.

Solve the quadratic equation below.

 $x_1 = -1.223 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.377$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $\frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
 $x_1 = -20.386 \text{ and } x_2 = 21.232$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
 $x_1 = -4.904 \text{ and } x_2 = 15.904$, which corresponds to using the Quadratic Formula with $a=1$
Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.
