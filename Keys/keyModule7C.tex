31. Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{-40}{-30x + 50} + 1 = \frac{-40}{-30x + 50} \] 
The solution is $ \text{all solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-2,-1] $ 

 $x = -1.667$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-30x + 50$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction. 
\item $ \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} $ 

 *$x = 1.667$ leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x_1 \in [-2, -1] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1,4] $ 

 $x = -1.667 \text{ and } x = 1.667$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation. 
\item $ x_1 \in [1, 4] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1,4] $ 

 $x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = 1.667$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation. 
\item $ x \in [1.67,3.67] $ 

 $x = 1.667$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

32. Choose the graph of the equation below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x - 1)^2} - 2 \] 

 
 The solution is  
 \begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Figures/rationalEquationToGraphCD.png} \end{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} 
\hline 
 & \tabularnewline 
 \textbf{A.} \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Figures/rationalEquationToGraphAC.png} & \textbf{B.} \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Figures/rationalEquationToGraphBC.png} \tabularnewline

 \end{tabular} 
 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item This is the correct option.  
\item Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{(x+h)^2}+k$ and the opposite leading coefficient.  
\item Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x}$.  
\item Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{(x+h)^2}+k$, and the opposite leading coefficient.  
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.

-----------------------------------------------

33. Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{2x}{-2x + 3} + \frac{-5x^{2}}{-6x^{2} +23 x -21} = \frac{3}{3x -7} \] 
The solution is $ \text{There are two solutions: } x = -1.000 \text{ and } x = 9.000 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x_1 \in [-3, 2] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1,4] $ 

  
\item $ x_1 \in [-3, 2] \text{ and } x_2 \in [7,13] $ 

 * $x = -1.000 \text{ and } x = 9.000$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [6,12] $ 

  
\item $ x \in [0,7] $ 

  
\item $ \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

34. Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{3}{24x^{2} -8 x -16} \] 
The solution is $ \text{All Real numbers except } x = -0.667 \text{ and } x = 1.000. $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \text{All Real numbers.} $ 

 This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers. 
\item $ \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-0.9, 0.3] \text{ and } b \in [0.1, 1.1] $ 

 All Real numbers except $x = -0.667$ and $x = 1.000$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-25.5, -22.5] $ 

 All Real numbers except $x = -24.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator. 
\item $ \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-0.9, 0.3] $ 

 All Real numbers except $x = -0.667$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator. 
\item $ \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-25.5, -22.5] \text{ and } b \in [14.6, 16.4] $ 

 All Real numbers except $x = -24.000$ and $x = 16.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: The new domain is the intersection of the previous domains.

-----------------------------------------------

35. Choose the equation of the function graphed below.
\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Figures/rationalGraphToEquationC.png} \end{center} 

The solution is $ f(x) = \frac{-1}{x + 3} - 2 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x + 3)^2} - 2 $ 

 Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$. 
\item $ f(x) = \frac{1}{(x - 3)^2} - 2 $ 

 Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$, and the opposite leading coefficient. 
\item $ f(x) = \frac{-1}{x + 3} - 2 $ 

 This is the correct option. 
\item $ f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 3} - 2 $ 

 Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$ and the opposite leading coefficient. 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 This corresponds to believing the vertex of the graph was not correct. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.
