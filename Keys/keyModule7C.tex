Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{5x}{4x + 3} + \frac{-4x^{2}}{16x^{2} -8 x -15} = \frac{3}{4x -5} \]

The solution is \( \text{There are two solutions: } x = -0.222 \text{ and } x = 2.534 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-2.7, 0.4] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.4,6] \)

* $x = -0.222 \text{ and } x = 2.534$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)


\item \( x_1 \in [-2.7, 0.4] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.8,-0.6] \)


\item \( x \in [0.4,2] \)


\item \( x \in [1.9,4.7] \)

Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{5}{30x^{2} -49 x + 20} \]

The solution is \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = 0.800 \text{ and } x = 0.833. \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [19.98, 20.01] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 20.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [0.77, 0.83] \text{ and } b \in [0.82, 0.86] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 0.800$ and $x = 0.833$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [19.98, 20.01] \text{ and } b \in [29.97, 30.02] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 20.000$ and $x = 30.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [0.77, 0.83] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 0.800$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.

Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{-60}{60x + 30} + 1 = \frac{-60}{60x + 30} \]

The solution is \( \text{all solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

$x = -0.500 \text{ and } x = 0.500$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

*$x = -0.500$ leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution, which is the correct option.
\item \( x \in [-2.5,0.5] \)

$x = -0.500$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
\item \( x_1 \in [-2.7, -0.4] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.5,0] \)

$x = -0.500 \text{ and } x = -0.500$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [-0.2,0.8] \)

$x = 0.500$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $60x + 30$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.

\item \( x \in [-0.25,2.75] \)

$x = 0.750$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
