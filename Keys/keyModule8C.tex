36. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ 5^{-5x+3} = 343^{-3x-4} \] 
The solution is $ x = -2.977 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [11, 16] $ 

 $x = 14.090$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only. 
\item $ x \in [-5, -1] $ 

 * $x = -2.977$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [3, 7] $ 

 $x = 3.500$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different. 
\item $ x \in [-2, 0] $ 

 $x = -0.739$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.

-----------------------------------------------

37. Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = e^{x-7}-2 \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [0, 6] $ 

 $(2, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [-4, -1] $ 

 $(-\infty, -2)$, which corresponds to using the correct vertical shift *if we wanted the Range*. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [0, 6] $ 

 $[2, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [-4, -1] $ 

 $(-\infty, -2]$, which corresponds to using the correct vertical shift *if we wanted the Range* AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 * This is the correct option. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.

-----------------------------------------------

38.  Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains $x$ (if it exists).
\[  8 = \ln{\sqrt[5]{\frac{8}{e^{7x}}}} \] 
The solution is $ x = -5.417, \text{ which does not fit in any of the interval options.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-2.07, -1.8] $ 

 $x = -1.989$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root. 
\item $ x \in [-1.81, -1.58] $ 

 $x = -1.782$, which corresponds to thinking you need to take the natural log of the left side before reducing. 
\item $ x \in [5.4, 5.45] $ 

 $x = 5.417$, which is the negative of the correct solution. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 *$x = -5.417$ is the correct solution and does not fit in any of the other intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(8)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.

-----------------------------------------------

39. Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ \log_{5}{(3x+8)}+6 = 2 \] 
The solution is $ x = -2.666 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ x \in [-340, -335] $ 

 $x = -338.667$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting and reversing the value with $x$. 
\item $ x \in [-7, 1] $ 

 * $x = -2.666$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ x \in [-2, 9] $ 

 $x = 5.667$, which corresponds to ignoring the vertical shift when converting to exponential form. 
\item $ x \in [-348, -343] $ 

 $x = -344.000$, which corresponds to reversing the base and exponent when converting. 
\item $ \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} $ 

 Corresponds to believing a negative coefficient within the log equation means there is no Real solution. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} First, get the equation in the form $\log_b{(cx+d)} = a$. Then, convert to $b^a = cx+d$ and solve.

-----------------------------------------------

40. Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -\log_2{(x+9)}+5 \] 
The solution is $ (-9, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], a \in [-8, -3] $ 

 $(-\infty, -5]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND including the endpoint AND flipping the domain. 
\item $ (a, \infty), a \in [-10, -6] $ 

 * $(-9, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ [a, \infty), a \in [0, 8] $ 

 $[5, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift when shifting the Domain AND including the endpoint. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), a \in [8, 13] $ 

 $(-\infty, 9)$, which corresponds to flipping the Domain. Remember: the general for is $a*\log(x-h)+k$, \textbf{where $a$ does not affect the domain}. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 This corresponds to thinking of the range of the log function (or the domain of the exponential function). 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.
