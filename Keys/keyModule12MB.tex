The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $100^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $12^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 25 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $53^{\circ}$ C. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ correctly.
This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
This uses $A$ as the bath temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
This uses $A$ correctly and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
* This is the correct answer as $k = -0.03055$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The initial temperature is when $t = 0$. Unlike power models, that means $A$ is not the initial temperature!

For the scenario below, model the rate of vibration (cm/s) of the string in terms of the length of the string. Then determine the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible). The constant should be in terms of cm and s.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string. The rate of vibration of string $\omega$ increases as the quartic length of the string decreases. For example, when string $\omega$ is 5 mm long, the rate of vibration is 33 cm/s. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( k = 2.06 \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* This is the correct option, which corresponds to the model $R = \frac{k}{l^{4}}$ AND converts from mm to cm.
This option uses the model $R = kl^{4}$ as if this is a direct variation AND does not convert from mm to cm so that the units match.
This option uses the correct model, $R = \frac{k}{l^{4}}$, but does not convert from mm to cm so that the units match.
This option uses the model $R = kl^{4}$ as if this is a direct variation.
Talk with the coordinator if you chose this option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The most common mistake on this question is to not convert mm to cm! When modeling, you need to make sure all of the units for your variables are compatible.

For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 49 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 14 \text{ percent} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}* This is the correct option.
This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.

The solution is \( \text{Linear model} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}For this to be the correct option, we want an extremely slow change early, then a rapid change later.
For this to be the correct option, we need to see a polynomial or rational shape.
For this to be the correct option, we need to see a mostly straight line of points.
For this to be the correct option, we want a rapid change early, then an extremely slow change later.
For this to be the correct option, we want to see no pattern in the points.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This question is testing if you can associate the models with their graphical representation. If you are having trouble, go back to the corresponding Core module to learn about the specific function you are having trouble recognizing.

    \textit{ In CHM2045L, Brittany created a 20 liter 30 percent solution of chemical $\chi$ using two different solution percentages of chemical $\chi$. When she went to write her lab report, she realized she forgot to write the amount of each solution she used! If she remembers she used 19 percent and 46 percent solutions, what was the amount she used of the 46 percent solution? }

You may have chose this if you thought you needed to know how much of the second solution was used in the problem. Remember that the total minus the first solution would give you the second amount used.
