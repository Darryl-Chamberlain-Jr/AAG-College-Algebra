11. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -9 + 6 x > 8 x \text{ or } 5 + 6 x < 8 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -4.5) \text{ or } (2.5, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5.5, -3.8] \text{ and } b \in [-1, 4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-4, 1] \text{ and } b \in [4, 7.1] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-8, -3] \text{ and } b \in [2.1, 3.8] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.3, -0.8] \text{ and } b \in [4, 8] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 6 - 9 x < \frac{-28 x + 3}{6} \leq 6 - 5 x $$ 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-2, -0.5] \text{ and } b \in [-18, -13] $ 

 $(-1.27, -16.50]$, which is the correct interval but negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-2.8, -1.2] \text{ and } b \in [-18, -14] $ 

 $[-1.27, -16.50)$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.6, -0.4] \text{ and } b \in [-21, -13] $ 

 $(-\infty, -1.27) \cup [-16.50, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-6, -1] \text{ and } b \in [-20, -16] $ 

 $(-\infty, -1.27] \cup (-16.50, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality AND getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 * This is correct as the answer should be $(1.27, 16.50]$. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -8x + 6 < 4x -9 $$ 
The solution is $ (1.25, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 7] $ 

  $(-\infty, 1.25)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-9, 1] $ 

  $(-\infty, -1.25)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 2] $ 

 * $(1.25, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2, 1] $ 

  $(-1.25, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{6}{3} - \frac{4}{9} x > \frac{5}{7} x - \frac{5}{4} $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 2.805) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-6, -2] $ 

  $(-\infty, -2.805)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5, 0] $ 

  $(-2.805, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [2, 5] $ 

 * $(-\infty, 2.805)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 6] $ 

  $(2.805, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No less than } 8 \text{ units from the number } 9. $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 1] \cup [17, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (1, 17) $ 

 This describes the values less than 8 from 9 
\item $ (-\infty, 1] \cup [17, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 8 from 9 
\item $ (-\infty, 1) \cup (17, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 8 from 9 
\item $ [1, 17] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 8 from 9 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 You likely thought the values in the interval were not correct. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points.
