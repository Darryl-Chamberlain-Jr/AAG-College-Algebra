11. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -5x -7 \leq 9x -5 $$ 
The solution is $ [-0.143, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-0.37, -0.1] $ 

  $(-\infty, -0.143]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.04, 0.34] $ 

  $[0.143, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.95, -0.05] $ 

 * $[-0.143, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [0.07, 0.25] $ 

  $(-\infty, 0.143]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ \frac{9}{9} - \frac{4}{3} x \leq \frac{-3}{5} x - \frac{8}{8} $$ 
The solution is $ [2.727, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-9, -2] $ 

  $[-2.727, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [1, 6] $ 

  $(-\infty, 2.727]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-5, -2] $ 

  $(-\infty, -2.727]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 4] $ 

 * $[2.727, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

13. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
$$ \text{ No more than } 6 \text{ units from the number } 8. $$ 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-2, 14) $ 

 This describes the values less than 8 from 6 
\item $ [-2, 14] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 8 from 6 
\item $ (-\infty, -2) \cup (14, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 8 from 6 
\item $ (-\infty, -2] \cup [14, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 8 from 6 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 Options A-D described the values [more/less than] 8 units from 6, which is the reverse of what the question asked. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ 3 + 7 x > 10 x \text{ or } 6 + 4 x < 5 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 1.0) \text{ or } (6.0, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-9, -4] \text{ and } b \in [-3, 4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 5] \text{ and } b \in [2, 10] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 3] \text{ and } b \in [5, 9] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-7, -3] \text{ and } b \in [-3, 3] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
$$ -3 + 4 x < \frac{36 x + 7}{8} \leq 3 + 4 x $$ 
The solution is $ (-7.75, 4.25] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-9, -7] \text{ and } b \in [-1, 6] $ 

 $(-\infty, -7.75] \cup (4.25, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-14, -6] \text{ and } b \in [3, 6] $ 

 $(-\infty, -7.75) \cup [4.25, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-10, -3] \text{ and } b \in [1, 7] $ 

 * $(-7.75, 4.25]$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-13, -4] \text{ and } b \in [3, 6] $ 

 $[-7.75, 4.25)$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.
