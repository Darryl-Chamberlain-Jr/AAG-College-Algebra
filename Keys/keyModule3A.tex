1. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{9} x > \frac{8}{7} x - \frac{5}{3} \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 3.912) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [2, 7] $ 

 * $(-\infty, 3.912)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-5, -3] $ 

  $(-\infty, -3.912)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5, -1] $ 

  $(-3.912, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 4] $ 

  $(3.912, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative. 

-----------------------------------------------

2. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -7 - 4 x \leq \frac{-23 x + 9}{7} < -8 - 7 x \] 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [11, 14] \text{ and } b \in [0, 5] $ 

 $[11.60, 2.50)$, which is the correct interval but negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [9, 14] \text{ and } b \in [-2, 5] $ 

 $(-\infty, 11.60) \cup [2.50, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality AND getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [9, 19] \text{ and } b \in [2, 6] $ 

 $(-\infty, 11.60] \cup (2.50, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [10, 13] \text{ and } b \in [2, 4] $ 

 $(11.60, 2.50]$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 * This is correct as the answer should be $[-11.60, -2.50)$. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution. 

-----------------------------------------------

3. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -5 + 9 x > 10 x \text{ or } -8 + 3 x < 6 x \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -5.0) \text{ or } (-2.667, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 6] \text{ and } b \in [2, 9] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-8, -3] \text{ and } b \in [-5, 0] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [1, 4] \text{ and } b \in [0, 8] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-7, -3] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 1] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign. 

-----------------------------------------------

4. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -10x -3 \leq -8x -5 \] 
The solution is $ [1.0, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.1, -0.8] $ 

  $[-1.0, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-0.3, 2.5] $ 

  $(-\infty, 1.0]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-1.4, -0.6] $ 

  $(-\infty, -1.0]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0.4, 3] $ 

 * $[1.0, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative. 

-----------------------------------------------

0. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
\[ \text{ More than } 10 \text{ units from the number } 1. \] 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (9, 11) $ 

 This describes the values less than 1 from 10 
\item $ (-\infty, 9] \cup [11, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 1 from 10 
\item $ (-\infty, 9) \cup (11, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 1 from 10 
\item $ [9, 11] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 1 from 10 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 Options A-D described the values [more/less than] 1 units from 10, which is the reverse of what the question asked. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points.
