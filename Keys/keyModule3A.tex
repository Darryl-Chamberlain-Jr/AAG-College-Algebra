11. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ \frac{8}{2} - \frac{8}{6} x > \frac{-4}{8} x - \frac{7}{5} \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, 6.48) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [3, 9] $ 

  $(6.48, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-9, -6] $ 

  $(-\infty, -6.48)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [3, 9] $ 

 * $(-\infty, 6.48)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-10, -5] $ 

  $(-6.48, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

12. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -9 + 9 x > 11 x \text{ or } 9 + 5 x < 8 x \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -4.5) \text{ or } (3.0, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-4.6, -4.1] \text{ and } b \in [2, 4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.8, -0.5] \text{ and } b \in [4, 6] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-4.06, -1.72] \text{ and } b \in [3.3, 4.7] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-4.82, -3.78] \text{ and } b \in [1.9, 3.7] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

-----------------------------------------------

13. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -8x -10 \leq 7x -6 \] 
The solution is $ [-0.267, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-1.03, -0.2] $ 

 * $[-0.267, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-1.68, 0.13] $ 

  $(-\infty, -0.267]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [0.14, 1.06] $ 

  $(-\infty, 0.267]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0.06, 0.39] $ 

  $[0.267, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

-----------------------------------------------

14. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -8 + 5 x < \frac{26 x - 9}{3} \leq 9 + 8 x \] 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [1, 7] \text{ and } b \in [-25, -14] $ 

 $(-\infty, 1.36) \cup [-18.00, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [0, 2] \text{ and } b \in [-19, -16] $ 

 $[1.36, -18.00)$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 2] \text{ and } b \in [-25, -16] $ 

 $(-\infty, 1.36] \cup (-18.00, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality AND getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [-0.2, 4.2] \text{ and } b \in [-21, -15] $ 

 $(1.36, -18.00]$, which is the correct interval but negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 * This is correct as the answer should be $(-1.36, 18.00]$. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.

-----------------------------------------------

15. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
\[ \text{ No more than } 7 \text{ units from the number } -7. \] 
The solution is $ [-14, 0] $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ [-14, 0] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 7 from -7 
\item $ (-14, 0) $ 

 This describes the values less than 7 from -7 
\item $ (-\infty, -14] \cup [0, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 7 from -7 
\item $ (-\infty, -14) \cup (0, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 7 from -7 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 You likely thought the values in the interval were not correct. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points.
