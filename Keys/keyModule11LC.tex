71. To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 6 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{6}{x} - 1}{x - 6} \] 
The solution is $ \{ 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010, 6.0001 \} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \{ 5.9000, 5.9900, 5.9990, 5.9999 \} $ 

 These values would estimate the limit of 6 on the left. 
\item $ \{ 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010, 6.0001 \} $ 

 This is correct! 
\item $ \{ 6.0000, 6.1000, 6.0100, 6.0010 \} $ 

 If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 6 doesn't help us estimate the limit. 
\item $ \{ 6.0000, 5.9000, 5.9900, 5.9990 \} $ 

 If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 6 doesn't help us estimate the limit. 
\item $ \{ 5.9000, 5.9900, 6.0100, 6.1000 \} $ 

 These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

-----------------------------------------------

72. Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?
$f(x)$ approaches $2.96$ as $x$ approaches $0$. 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above are always true.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ f(2) = 0 $ 

  
\item $ f(0) = 2 $ 

  
\item $ f(0) \text{ is close to or exactly } 2 $ 

  
\item $ f(2) \text{ is close to or exactly } 0 $ 

  
\item $ \text{None of the above are always true.} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General comments:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $0$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(x)$!

-----------------------------------------------

73. Evaluate the one-sided limit of the function $f(x)$ below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow -6^-} \frac{2}{(x-6)^5}+5 \] 
The solution is $ f(-6) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ \infty $ 

  
\item $ -\infty $ 

  
\item $ f(-6) $ 

  
\item $ \text{The limit does not exist} $ 

  
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General comments:} You should be able to graph the rational function displayed. If not, go back to Module 7 to learn about the general shape of rational functions.

-----------------------------------------------

74. Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 8} \frac{\sqrt{5x - 15} - 5}{7x - 56} \] 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ 0.014 $ 

 You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here. 
\item $ \infty $ 

 You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity. 
\item $ 0.100 $ 

 You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here. 
\item $ 0.319 $ 

 You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials. 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 * This is the correct option as the limit is 0.071. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 8$.

-----------------------------------------------

75. For the graph below, find the value(s) $a$ that makes the limit true: $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ does not exist.
\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../Figures/evaluateLimitGraphicallyC.png} \end{center} 

The solution is $ 1 $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ 3 $ 

  
\item $ 1 $ 

  
\item $ -2 $ 

  
\item $ \text{Multiple } a \text{ make the limit true}. $ 

  
\item $ \text{No } a \text{ make the limit true}. $ 

  
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comments:} Remember that the limit does not exist if the left-hand and right-hand limits do not match.
