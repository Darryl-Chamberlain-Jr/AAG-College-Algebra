Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 3} \frac{\sqrt{6x - 2} - 4}{5x - 15} \]

The solution is \( 0.150 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 0.025 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( 0.125 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( 0.150 \)


\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you got a limit that does not match any of the above, please contact the coordinator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 3$.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 7 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{7}{x} - 1}{x - 7} \]

The solution is \( \{ 7.1000, 7.0100, 7.0010, 7.0001 \} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 7.0000, 7.1000, 7.0100, 7.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 7 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 6.9000, 6.9900, 7.0100, 7.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 7.0000, 6.9000, 6.9900, 6.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 7 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 6.9000, 6.9900, 6.9990, 6.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 7 on the left.
\item \( \{ 7.1000, 7.0100, 7.0010, 7.0001 \} \)

This is correct!

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 2 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{2}{x} - 1}{x - 2} \]

The solution is \( \{ 2.1000, 2.0100, 2.0010, 2.0001 \} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
