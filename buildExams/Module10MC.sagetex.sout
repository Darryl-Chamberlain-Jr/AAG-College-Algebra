The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string. The rate of vibration of string $\omega$ increases as the square length of the string increases. For example, when string $\omega$ is 5 mm long, the rate of vibration is 40 cm/s.}{}{}{}{}}

In an alternative galaxy, the quartic of the time, $T$ (Earth years), required for a planet to orbit Sun $\chi$ increases as the square of the distance, $d$ (AUs), that the planet is from Sun $\chi$ increases.
