Big O notation is common in computer science to describe how fast a program can solve a particular problem. Big O notation categorizes functions according to their growth rates, the same way we have categorized modeling real-world problems by certain types of functions. When analyzing a particular program, a student found the computer to need $x^x$ time to complete, where $x$ was the number of inputs into the program.}{}{}{}{}}

In an alternative galaxy, the cube of the time, $T$ (Earth years), required for a planet to orbit Sun $\chi$ increases as the quartic of the distance, $d$ (AUs), that the planet is from Sun $\chi$ increases. For example, when Ea's average distance from Sun $\chi$ is 6, it takes 84 Earth days to complete an orbit.}{}{}{}{}}

The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string. The rate of vibration of string $\omega$ decreases as the quartic length of the string decreases. For example, when string $\omega$ is 5 mm long, the rate of vibration is 20 cm/s.}{}{}{}{}}
