Using the scenario below, model the situation using an exponential function and a base of $\frac{1}{2}$. Then, solve for the half-life of the element, rounding to the nearest day.}{}{}{}{}}
\newlabel{@sageinline1}{{%
The half-life of an element is the amount of time it takes for the element to decay to half of its initial starting amount. There is initially 695 grams of element $X$ and after 11 years there is 99 grams remaining.}{}{}{}{}}

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.}{}{}{}{}}
