# AAG-College-Algebra
# Welcome!
This repository is a **work-in-progress** on automatically generating assessments in a College Algebra course. By *automatically*, we mean that assessments are generated (via a combination of technology) with little input from the user. This is achieved by front-loading the creation of question structures and associated conceptions/errors that are later called by a shell script to create PDF versions of assessments for instructors to utilize in the classroom. Published and under-review articles on this project are housed [here](Articles). The related project, an open-source College Algebra online homework system, is housed [here](https://github.com/Darryl-Chamberlain-Jr/mac1105summer2020).

**No coding experience is required to use this work as-is.** If you would like to generate exams through the shell scripts, here is what you will need to do.

1. Download the necessary programs.
   This code uses Python, SageMath, and LaTeX to create the questions and compile the questions into a PDF assessment. All three are open-source and available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
2. Download the repository. 
   We suggest downloading the repository to a folder in your home directory. As we use many git repositories, we have a git-
