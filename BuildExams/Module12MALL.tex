The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed.
\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $100^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $12^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 25 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $53^{\circ}$ C. }

For the scenario below, model the rate of vibration (cm/s) of the string in terms of the length of the string. Then determine the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible). The constant should be in terms of cm and s.
