Using the scenario below, model the situation using an exponential function and a base of $\frac{1}{2}$. Then, solve for the half-life of the element, rounding to the nearest day.

    \textit{ The half-life of an element is the amount of time it takes for the element to decay to half of its initial starting amount. There is initially 974 grams of element $X$ and after 3 years there is 108 grams remaining. }

For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 43 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
