The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed.
\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $100^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $12^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 25 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $53^{\circ}$ C. }

For the scenario below, model the rate of vibration (cm/s) of the string in terms of the length of the string. Then determine the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible). The constant should be in terms of cm and s.
\begin{center}
    \textit{ The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string. The rate of vibration of string $\omega$ increases as the quartic length of the string decreases. For example, when string $\omega$ is 5 mm long, the rate of vibration is 33 cm/s. }

For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 49 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
